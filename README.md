# Amazon Clone

A front-end clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS. I created this project to replicate the design, layout, and responsiveness of Amazon's homepage and product pages while enhancing my front-end development skills.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Header Navigation**: Fully functional header with search bar, navigation links, and dropdown menus.
- **Product Display**: Grid-based product layout for showcasing items.
- **Footer Section**: Includes links to various informational pages and social media.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on buttons and images.

- ## Future Improvements

- I plan to add JavaScript functionality for interactivity (e.g., search bar suggestions, dynamic content loading).
- Include user authentication and cart management features.
- Optimize for performance and faster loading times.
